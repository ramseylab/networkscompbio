    "# CS446/546 - Class Session 19 - Correlation network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class session we are going to analyze gene expression data from a human bladder cancer cohort, using python. We will load a data matrix of expression measurements of 4,473 genes in 414 different bladder cancer samples. These genes have been selected because they are differentially expressed between normal bladder and bladder cancer (thus more likely to have a function in bladder cancer specifically), but the columns in the data matrix are restricted to bladder cancer samples (not normal bladder) because we want to obtain a network representing variation across cancers. The measurements in the matrix have already been normalized to account for inter-sample heterogeneity and then log2 transformed. Our job is to compute Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs of genes, obtain Fisher-transformed *z*-scores for all pairs of genes, test each pair of genes for significance of the *z* score, adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, filter to eliminate any pair for which *R* < 0.75 or *P*adj > 0.01, load the graph into an `igraph.Graph` object, and plot the degree distribution on log-log scale. We will then answer two questions: (1) does the network look to be scale-free? and (2) what is it's best-fit scaling exponent?"

    "For each of the gene pairs for which R>0.75, see if you can compute the t-test P value for each correlation coefficient (don't bother adjusting for false discovery rate control).  Compare to the (un-adjusted) P values that you got using the Fisher transformation, using a scatter plot.  How do they compare?  Which test has better statistical power, for this case where M = 414? (If you are wondering, *general* advice is to use Fisher if M>=10; for very small numbers of samples, use the Student t test)."
